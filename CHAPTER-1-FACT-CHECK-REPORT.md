- Reference #5 (seven founders) can be updated from "Needs Verification" to verified
- Reference #18 (Boris Cherny) remains correctly marked as unverified

### 3. Minor Timeline Clarification
- Blake Lemoine's claims were in 2022, not "whispering" during 2021

## Overall Assessment

Chapter 1 is highly accurate with well-sourced claims. Only one claim (Boris Cherny) cannot be verified, and the chapter already marks it as such. The factual content about Anthropic's founding, the key people involved, and the technical background is correct and properly cited.
