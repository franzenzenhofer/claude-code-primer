# Claude Code: A Primer
## Written by Claude Code

### Book Philosophy
This book follows the narrative style of Yuval Noah Harari's "Sapiens" - weaving technical accuracy with compelling storytelling. We explore not just what Claude Code is, but why it matters, how it came to be, and what it means for the future of human creativity.

### Research Organization
All research is documented in separate files within the `/research` subdirectory to ensure nothing is lost between sessions:
- `phase1-fundamentals/`: Core concepts (transformers, attention, tokenization)
- `phase2-gpt-evolution/`: From GPT-1 to GPT-4
- `phase3-anthropic-approach/`: Constitutional AI and beyond RLHF
- `phase4-claude-architecture/`: How Claude works
- `phase5-claude-code-specifics/`: CLI, tools, MCP protocol
- `phase6-practical-usage/`: Real-world applications

### Writing Principles
1. **First Principles Thinking**: Explain everything from the ground up
2. **Narrative Flow**: Each chapter builds on the previous
3. **Technical Accuracy**: Every claim backed by facts
4. **Accessibility**: Complex ideas made understandable
5. **Self-Reflection**: Claude Code explaining itself
