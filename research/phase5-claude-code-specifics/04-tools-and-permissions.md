# Research Notes: Claude Code Tools and Permissions - Safety in Action

## Permission Architecture Philosophy

Claude Code's permission system embodies Anthropic's "safety through design" principle - powerful capabilities with transparent, user-controlled access controls.

### Core Principles:
1. **Explicit Consent**: Users approve each tool and operation
2. **Graduated Access**: Start restricted, expand based on trust
3. **Transparent Operations**: Clear logging of all actions
4. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Conservative permissions by default
5. **User Education**: Explain implications of each permission

## Permission Levels and Modes

### Standard Mode (`claude`):
- **File Reading**: Can read files user explicitly shares
- **Code Analysis**: Analyze and explain existing code
- **Suggestions**: Provide recommendations without execution
- **Safe Operations**: Non-destructive actions only

### Enhanced Mode (`claude+`):
- **File Modification**: Edit and create files
- **Command Execution**: Run shell commands and scripts
- **Git Operations**: Version control management
- **System Integration**: Broader tool access

### Enterprise Mode:
- **Audit Trails**: Complete operation logging
- **Policy Enforcement**: Organizational restrictions
- **Resource Quotas**: Usage and cost controls
- **Team Coordination**: Shared permission sets

## Core Tool Categories

### 1. File System Tools

#### Read Operations:
```typescript
// Permission: filesystem:read
tools: {
  read_file: {
    description: "Read file contents",
    permissions: ["filesystem:read"],
    safeguards: ["path_validation", "size_limits"]
  },
  list_directory: {
    description: "List directory contents", 
    permissions: ["filesystem:read"],
    safeguards: ["scope_restriction"]
  }
}
```

#### Write Operations:
```typescript
// Permission: filesystem:write  
tools: {
  write_file: {
    description: "Create or modify files",
    permissions: ["filesystem:write"],
    safeguards: ["backup_creation", "confirmation_prompt"]
  },
  delete_file: {
    description: "Remove files",
    permissions: ["filesystem:write", "destructive_ops"],
    safeguards: ["explicit_confirmation", "undo_capability"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Shell Execution Tools

#### Safe Commands:
```typescript
// Permission: shell:read
tools: {
  run_command: {
    description: "Execute read-only commands",
    permissions: ["shell:read"],
    allowed_commands: ["ls", "grep", "find", "cat", "head", "tail"],
    safeguards: ["command_validation", "output_limits"]
  }
}
```

#### Privileged Commands:
```typescript
// Permission: shell:write
tools: {
  run_privileged_command: {
    description: "Execute system-modifying commands",
    permissions: ["shell:write", "system_admin"],
    blocked_commands: ["rm -rf", "dd", "mkfs", "fdisk"],
    safeguards: ["confirmation_required", "simulation_mode"]
  }
}
```

### 3. Git Integration Tools

#### Repository Operations:
```typescript
// Permission: git:basic
tools: {
  git_status: {
    description: "Check repository status",
    permissions: ["git:basic"],
    safeguards: ["repository_scope"]
  },
  git_commit: {
    description: "Create commits",
    permissions: ["git:write"],
    safeguards: ["message_validation", "diff_review"]
  },
  git_push: {
    description: "Push to remote",
    permissions: ["git:remote"],
    safeguards: ["branch_protection", "force_push_prevention"]
  }
}
```

### 4. Network and API Tools

#### Web Access:
```typescript
// Permission: network:http
tools: {
  http_request: {
    description: "Make HTTP requests",
    permissions: ["network:http"],
    safeguards: ["url_validation", "rate_limiting", "response_size_limits"]
  },
  api_call: {
    description: "Call external APIs",
    permissions: ["network:api"],
    safeguards: ["api_key_protection", "quota_enforcement"]
  }
}
```

## Permission Configuration

### CLAUDE.md Configuration:
```markdown
# Project Permissions Configuration

## Allowed Tools
- filesystem: read, write (excluding system directories)
- shell: read-only commands, specific write operations
- git: all operations except force push
- network: HTTP requests to approved domains

## Restricted Operations
- System configuration changes
- Package installations requiring sudo
- Database schema modifications
- Production deployments

## Safety Overrides
- Always confirm destructive operations
- Create backups before major changes
- Require explicit approval for external API calls
- Log all file system modifications
```

### User Consent Workflows:

#### First-Time Permission Request:
```
Claude Code is requesting permission to:
- Read files in the current directory
- Execute git commands
- Install npm packages

This will allow Claude to:
✓ Analyze your codebase
✓ Manage version control
✓ Install dependencies

⚠️  Claude will NOT be able to:
✗ Access files outside this project
✗ Make system-wide changes
✗ Access network resources

[Allow] [Deny] [Customize]
```

#### Escalated Permission Request:
```
Claude Code needs additional permissions:
- Write access to database configuration
- Execute deployment scripts

⚠️  This is a sensitive operation that could:
- Modify production settings
- Affect system security
- Impact other users

Reason: "Deploy updated authentication system"

[Allow Once] [Allow Always] [Deny] [Review Code First]
```

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Pre-execution Validation

#### Command Sanitization:
```typescript
function validateCommand(command: string): ValidationResult {
  // Check against blacklist
  const dangerousPatterns = [
    /rm\s+-rf\s+\//, // Recursive delete of root
    /dd\s+if=.*of=/, // Direct disk operations  
    /sudo\s+/, // Privilege escalation
    /curl.*\|\s*sh/, // Pipe to shell execution
  ];
  
  for (const pattern of dangerousPatterns) {
    if (pattern.test(command)) {
      return { allowed: false, reason: "Potentially destructive operation" };
    }
  }
  
  return { allowed: true };
}
```

#### File Path Validation:
```typescript
function validateFilePath(path: string): ValidationResult {
  // Prevent access to sensitive directories
  const restrictedPaths = [
    '/etc/', '/usr/', '/bin/', '/sbin/',
    '~/.ssh/', '~/.aws/', '~/.config/claude/'
  ];
  
  const absolutePath = path.resolve(path);
  
  for (const restricted of restrictedPaths) {
    if (absolutePath.startsWith(restricted)) {
      return { allowed: false, reason: "Access to system directory denied" };
    }
  }
  
  return { allowed: true };
}
```

### 2. Operation Monitoring

#### Real-time Logging:
```typescript
interface OperationLog {
  timestamp: Date;
  tool: string;
  operation: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  result: 'success' | 'failure' | 'cancelled';
  impact: 'read' | 'write' | 'execute' | 'network';
  user_consent: boolean;
}
```

#### Audit Trail:
```
2024-07-05 21:45:23 - filesystem:write - create_file
  File: src/components/UserAuth.tsx
  Size: 2.4KB
  Consent: Explicit
  Backup: Created

2024-07-05 21:45:31 - git:write - commit  
  Message: "Add user authentication component"
  Files: 1 added, 0 modified, 0 deleted
  Consent: Inherited
  
2024-07-05 21:45:45 - shell:read - run_command
  Command: npm test
  Exit Code: 0
  Output: 15 tests passed
  Consent: Standing permission
```

### 3. Rollback and Recovery

#### Automatic Backups:
```typescript
interface BackupStrategy {
  before_file_modification: {
    create_backup: true;
    backup_location: '.claude/backups/';
    retention_policy: '7 days';
  };
  
  before_destructive_operation: {
    create_snapshot: true;
    snapshot_type: 'git_stash';
    description: 'Pre-operation state';
  };
}
```

#### Undo Capabilities:
```bash
# Claude tracks all operations for undo
claude undo last           # Undo last operation
claude undo file-changes   # Undo file modifications only  
claude undo git-commits    # Undo recent commits
claude restore-backup      # Restore from backup
```

## Enterprise Permission Management

### Role-Based Access Control:
```yaml
roles:
  junior_developer:
    permissions:
      - filesystem:read
      - git:basic
      - shell:read
    restrictions:
      - no_production_access
      - no_destructive_operations
      
  senior_developer:
    permissions:
      - filesystem:write
      - git:all
      - shell:write
      - network:api
    restrictions:
      - approval_required_for_deployment
      
  team_lead:
    permissions:
      - all_tools
    restrictions:
      - audit_trail_required
```

### Policy Enforcement:
```typescript
interface SecurityPolicy {
  max_file_modifications_per_session: 50;
  require_code_review_for_changes: true;
  block_external_api_calls: false;
  mandatory_backup_before_destructive_ops: true;
  session_timeout_minutes: 120;
}
```

## User Education and Transparency

### Permission Explanations:
When requesting permissions, Claude explains:
- **What** the permission allows
- **Why** it's needed for the current task
- **Risks** associated with granting it
- **Alternatives** if permission is denied
- **Scope** and limitations of the permission

### Progressive Disclosure:
- Start with minimal permissions
- Request additional access as needed
- Build trust through successful operations
- Provide educational context for each request

This permission system ensures Claude Code remains powerful yet safe...
