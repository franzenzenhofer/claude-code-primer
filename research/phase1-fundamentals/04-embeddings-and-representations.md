# Research Notes: Embeddings and Representations - The Language of Thought

## What Are Embeddings?

Embeddings are dense vector representations of tokens in high-dimensional space:
- Typical dimensions: 768 (BERT), 1536 (GPT-3), 4096+ (GPT-4/Claude)
- Each dimension captures some aspect of meaning
- Similar concepts have similar vectors

## The Journey from Token to Understanding:

### 1. Token Embeddings (Input Layer)
- Lookup table: token_id → vector
- Initialized randomly or with pre-trained values
- Vocabulary size × embedding dimension matrix
- Example: "cat" → [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ...]

### 2. Positional Embeddings
- Add position information to token embeddings
- Sinusoidal (original transformer) vs learned (GPT/Claude)
- Allows model to understand sequence order
- Critical for tasks like "reverse this list"

### 3. Contextual Embeddings (Hidden States)
- Token embeddings transformed through attention layers
- Each layer creates more abstract representations
- Early layers: syntax, surface features
- Deep layers: semantics, reasoning

## How Embeddings Encode Meaning:

### Semantic Relationships
Classic example: `king - man + woman ≈ queen`
- Gender direction: man→woman
- Royal direction: commoner→royalty
- These directions are consistent across the embedding space

### Syntactic Information
- Verb embeddings cluster by tense
- Plural nouns near each other
- Questions have distinctive patterns

### Multi-level Representations
Layer 0-4: Lexical features (spelling, basic syntax)
Layer 5-12: Syntactic structures (parse trees)
Layer 13-24: Semantic roles (agent, patient)
Layer 25+: Abstract reasoning, task-specific features

## The Embedding Pipeline in LLMs:

### 1. Input Processing
```
text → tokenizer → token_ids → embedding_lookup → token_embeddings
```

### 2. Position Addition
```
embedded = token_embeddings + positional_embeddings
```

### 3. Layer Transformations
```
for layer in transformer_layers:
    embedded = layer(embedded)  # Attention + FFN
```

### 4. Output Generation
```
final_hidden_state → output_projection → vocabulary_logits
```

## Special Embeddings in Modern LLMs:

### 1. Role Embeddings
- Different embeddings for system/user/assistant
- Helps model understand conversation structure

### 2. Task Embeddings
- Some models use special prefixes
- "Translate:", "Summarize:", etc.
- Guide model behavior

### 3. Instruction Embeddings
- Fine-tuned models develop specialized patterns
- "Think step-by-step" activates reasoning pathways

## Embeddings in Claude Code Context:

### Code Understanding
- Function names embed near their common uses
- Programming constructs have consistent patterns
- Language keywords cluster together

### Tool Embeddings
- Special tokens/patterns for tool use
- File paths have distinctive signatures
- Command patterns are recognized

### Error Recognition
- Stack traces activate debugging pathways
- Error messages trigger fix-searching behavior

## The Geometry of Thought:

### Directions in Embedding Space
- Certainty: "maybe" → "definitely"
- Formality: casual → formal
- Sentiment: negative → positive
- Complexity: simple → complex

### Manifolds and Clusters
- Concepts form manifolds in high-D space
- Related ideas create neighborhoods
- Analogies are parallel vectors

## Why Embeddings Matter:

1. **Compositional**: Complex meanings from simple parts
2. **Transferable**: Knowledge learned in one context applies to others
3. **Interpretable**: Can probe what models "know"
4. **Efficient**: Dense representations capture rich information

## Future Directions:

### Sparse Embeddings
- Most dimensions are zero
- More interpretable
- Potentially more efficient

### Multimodal Embeddings
- Same space for text, images, code
- Enables cross-modal reasoning

### Dynamic Embeddings
- Embeddings that adapt during inference
- Context-specific representations
