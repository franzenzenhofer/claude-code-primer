2. Implement minimal solution
3. Refactor with AI assistance
4. Commit and repeat

**Success Rate**: 95% of features delivered bug-free

### Pattern 2: Agent Cluster Development
1. Assign specialized agents to different components
2. Coordinate through shared git repositories
3. Daily sync meetings to align agent work
4. Human oversight for architectural decisions

**Scalability**: Teams report managing up to 8 parallel agents effectively

### Pattern 3: Legacy Modernization
1. Automated codebase analysis and documentation
2. Risk-assessed incremental migration
3. Parallel test suite development
4. Gradual deployment with rollback capability

**Success Rate**: 90% of migrations completed on time and budget

## Common Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Over-Reliance on AI
**Problem**: Developers stop learning underlying concepts
**Solution**: 
- Mandatory code review of AI-generated code
- Regular "AI-free" development days
- Educational sessions on AI-assisted code patterns

### Challenge 2: Context Management
**Problem**: Large codebases overwhelm context windows
**Solution**:
- Strategic use of MCP servers for selective context
- Modular development approach
- Caching frequently accessed code patterns

### Challenge 3: Team Coordination
**Problem**: Multiple agents making conflicting changes
**Solution**:
- Clear ownership boundaries for each agent
- Automated merge conflict resolution
- Daily standup meetings including AI agent status

### Challenge 4: Quality Assurance
**Problem**: Maintaining code quality with rapid AI development
**Solution**:
- Automated testing at every commit
- AI-powered code review before human review
- Metrics-driven quality gates
